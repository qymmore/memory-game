# Overview 
A mini project re-creating the classic memory game using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. I had quite a lot of fun building this and it got me to use a lot of basic JS knowledge to implement the functionalities of the game.

# My process

## Built with:
- Semantic HTML
- Custom CSS properties
- Vanilla JS

## Challenges 
- This game was relatively simple to create with JS. The main challenge was to come up with the logic behind controlling the states of each card and matching/not-matching them to a second card while also making sure that if they do not match then they flip back to their original state.

## Continued development
- Refactor the design to make it more responsive to smaller and larger screen sizes.
